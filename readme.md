# Polynomial Regression Implementation

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of polynomial regression using Python. The project uses synthetic data to illustrate the concepts and techniques of polynomial regression.

## Project Structure
- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the polynomial regression implementation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python libraries required to run the project.
- `LICENSE`: License file for the project.
- `.gitignore`: File specifying which files and directories to ignore in the Git repository.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required libraries by running:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Project
1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
    ```
2. Run the cells in the notebook to see the polynomial regression analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset is synthetically generated within the notebook using the following equation:
\[ y = 0.5x^2 + 1.5x + 2 + \text{outliers} \]

## Dependencies
The project requires the following libraries, as specified in `requirements.txt`:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- seaborn

You can install these dependencies using the command mentioned in the Installation section.
